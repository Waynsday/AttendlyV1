I told them I can if they provide it. Parents are very nice! Mom works here in the district. I just think they need a little reminder that he is missing too much school. He's a great student. He just needs to be here to get all the learning. We are on great terms and I have been very accommodating for them. I think a simple phone call from Mr. Machado would really get them to understand the importance of the situation. Please ask me if you need any more information. I think this is an easy fix.  ","Called home 9/25/24 @ 10:42am Spoke to mom and she explianed what is going on. Maverick has been having gut issues and getting tested. they found what could be causing him to be sick so they removed that from his diet. Mom understands the importance of coming to school and would not like for him to get behind, she states he should be fine now and attending school but if he ever feels sick to go to the health office but other then that he should be improving attendance unless he has dr. appts which she will bring in a dr. note if thats the case. ","12/9 He just keeps getting sick. He loves school and his pediatrician has recommended that he stays home when he is sick.  12/11 Parent called to discuss possible alternatives for his education since he does have medical conditions that often make him feel ill and she was wonderinig if he would be prepared for first grade.  I talked to Mrs. French, and she said he is not behind and she had no concerns at this time academically speaking. His mother was also concerned about his social emotional development. She feels he needs to stay in school as opposed to home schooling because he is just beginning to learn how to socialize appropriately with his peers. She will push him to come to school as much as possible, but sometimes things are just beyond her control. ",,
