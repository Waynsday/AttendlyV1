# ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to select a technology stack for the AP Tool that will support rapid development, ensure security for student data, provide excellent performance, and scale to support multiple school districts. The solution must comply with FERPA requirements and integrate with existing educational systems (Aeries SIS, i-Ready, School Status Attend).

## Decision
We will use the following technology stack:

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **UI Library**: React 19
- **Language**: TypeScript 5
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with shadcn-ui components
- **State Management**: Zustand (client-side)
- **Data Fetching**: React Query with Server Components

### Backend
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL 15)
- **ORM**: Prisma
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with SSO support
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime for live updates
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage for CSV uploads

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: AWS Fargate
- **CDN**: CloudFront
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, Prometheus, Grafana
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Consequences

### Positive
1. **Rapid Development**: Next.js and Supabase provide excellent developer experience
2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript prevents runtime errors and improves maintainability
3. **Security**: Supabase provides row-level security and built-in authentication
4. **Performance**: Server Components reduce client-side JavaScript
5. **Scalability**: PostgreSQL and AWS Fargate can handle district-wide deployments
6. **Cost-Effective**: Supabase pricing model aligns with our usage patterns

### Negative
1. **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Supabase ecosystem
2. **Vendor Lock-in**: Some dependency on Supabase features
3. **Complexity**: App Router is newer and has less community resources

### Risks
1. **Supabase Availability**: Mitigated by self-hosting option if needed
2. **Performance at Scale**: Mitigated by read replicas and caching
3. **Integration Complexity**: Mitigated by adapter pattern for external systems

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Traditional MEAN Stack
- **Pros**: Mature ecosystem, extensive resources
- **Cons**: More boilerplate, slower development, separate auth solution needed

### Alternative 2: Django + React
- **Pros**: Excellent admin interface, mature ORM
- **Cons**: Language context switching, less real-time support

### Alternative 3: AWS Amplify
- **Pros**: Tight AWS integration, serverless
- **Cons**: Steeper learning curve, less flexibility
